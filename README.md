# Hullrot-YAML-Prototypes
Contains all the hullrot YAML prototypes , for those wishing to do balance changes on them

These are part of the hullrot closed-source repository and are automatically pulled to the main-repository before a launch.
# Starter setup
If you want to conveniently make a pull request to the YAML prototypes i recommend you use Github desktop , clone this codebase, create a fork with the intent to contribute (github desktop will tell you to do this), create a branch for your changes and then change stuff in YAML. Since the YAML will be updated weekly per launch , i recommend you pull from upstream/master on your local-master branches that you will have after you fork, and then work off from those on any YAML PR you will do.
